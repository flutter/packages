      # This uses a pinned version of Flutter rather than `stable` so that it is
      # not subject to out-of-band failures when new releases happen. It does
      # not use the auto-rolled pin because there's no way for the autoroller
      # to test the actual release flow, so changes would still show up in
      # post-submit. A manually-rolled pin means that any changes here must be
      # made deliberately, so that the person updating it knows to watch the
      # next actual auto-release to ensure that it works, and knows to revert
      # the change if it doesn't.
