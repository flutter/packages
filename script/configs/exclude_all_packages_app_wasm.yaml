# This list should be kept as short as possible, and things should remain here
# only as long as necessary, since in general the goal is for all of the latest
# versions of packages to be mutually compatible, and compilable with Wasm.

# This is only used for wasm compilation. Once all packages in the repo have
# been migrated, remove this file and use `exclude_all_packages_app.yaml` only.

# Packages that aren't migrated yet.
