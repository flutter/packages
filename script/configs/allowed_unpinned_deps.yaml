# The list of external dependencies that are allowed as unpinned dependencies.
# See https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/ecosystem/contributing/README.md#Dependencies
#
# All entries here should have an explanation for why they are here, either
# via being part of one of the default-allowed groups, or a specific reason.

## Explicit allowances

# Owned by individual Flutter Team members.
# Ideally we would not do this, since there's no clear plan for what
# would happen if the individuals left the Flutter Team, and the
# repositories may or may not meet Flutter's security standards. Be
# cautious about adding to this list.
