## 2.4.0

* Add `forceFullMetadata` option to `pickImage`.
  * To keep this non-breaking `forceFullMetadata` defaults to `true`, so the plugin tries
   to get the full image metadata which may require extra permission requests on certain platforms.

   permission requests from the platform (e.g on iOS the plugin wonâ€™t ask for the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` permission).
