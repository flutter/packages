///
/// This is a variation of an [AnimatedSwitcher], but instead of using the
/// same transition for enter and exit, two separate transitions can be
/// specified, similar to how the enter and exit transitions of a [PageRoute]
/// are defined.
///
/// When a new [child] is specified, the [transitionBuilder] is effectively
/// applied twice, once to the old child and once to the new one. When
/// [reverse] is false, the old child's `secondaryAnimation` runs forward, and

/// When [reverse] is true, the old child's `primaryAnimation` runs in reverse
/// and the value of its `secondaryAnimation` is usually fixed at 0.0. The new
/// child's `secondaryAnimation` runs in reverse and the value of its
/// `primaryAnimation` is usually fixed at 1.0. This is similar to popping a
/// [PageRoute] to reveal another [PageRoute] underneath it.
///
/// This process is the same as the one used by [PageRoute.buildTransitions].
///
/// The following example shows a [transitionBuilder] that slides out the
/// old child to the right (driven by the `secondaryAnimation`) while the new
/// child fades in (driven by the `primaryAnimation`):
///
/// ```dart
/// transitionBuilder: (
///   Widget child,
///   Animation<double> primaryAnimation,
///   Animation<double> secondaryAnimation,
/// ) {
///   return SlideTransition(
///     position: Tween<Offset>(
///       begin: Offset.zero,
///       end: const Offset(1.5, 0.0),
///     ).animate(secondaryAnimation),
///     child: FadeTransition(
///       opacity: Tween<double>(
///         begin: 0.0,
///         end: 1.0,
///       ).animate(primaryAnimation),
///       child: child,
///     ),
///   );
/// },
/// ```
///
/// If the children are swapped fast enough (i.e. before [duration] elapses),
/// more than one old child can exist and be transitioning out while the
/// newest one is transitioning in.
///
/// If the *new* child is the same widget type and key as the *old* child,
/// but with different parameters, then [PageTransitionSwitcher] will *not* do a
/// transition between them, since as far as the framework is concerned, they
/// are the same widget and the existing widget can be updated with the new
/// parameters. To force the transition to occur, set a [Key] on each child
/// widget that you wish to be considered unique (typically a [ValueKey] on the
/// widget data that distinguishes this child from the others). For example,
/// changing the child from `SizedBox(width: 10)` to `SizedBox(width: 100)`
/// would not trigger a transition but changing the child from
/// `SizedBox(width: 10)` to `SizedBox(key: Key('foo'), width: 100)` would.
/// Similarly, changing the child to `Container(width: 10)` would trigger a
/// transition.
///
/// The same key can be used for a new child as was used for an already-outgoing
/// child; the two will not be considered related. For example, if a progress
/// indicator with key A is first shown, then an image with key B, then another
/// progress indicator with key A again, all in rapid succession, then the old
/// progress indicator and the image will be fading out while a new progress
/// indicator is fading in.
///
/// PageTransitionSwitcher uses the [layoutBuilder] property to lay out the
