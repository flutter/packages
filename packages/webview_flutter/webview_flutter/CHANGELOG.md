  (flutter/flutter@1d4d63a) for text input to work properly on all Android
  versions.

## 0.3.15+2

## 0.3.15+1

  for UIs that also have Flutter `TextInput` fields is still pending. This basic
  support currently only works with Flutter `master`. The keyboard will still
  appear when it previously did not when run with older versions of Flutter. But
  if the WebView is resized while showing the keyboard the text field will need
  to be focused multiple times for any input to be registered.

## 0.3.9+2

  the WebView to the Flutter app's Dart code.

## 0.3.0

* **Breaking change**. Migrate from the deprecated original Android Support
  Library to AndroidX. This shouldn't result in any functional changes, but it
  requires any Android apps using this plugin to [also
  migrate](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) if they're
  using the original support library.

## 0.2.0

* Added a evaluateJavascript method to WebView controller.
