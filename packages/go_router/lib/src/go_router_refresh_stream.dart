/// This class can be used to make `refreshListenable` react to events in the

/// Typical usage is as follows:
///
/// ```dart
/// GoRouter(
///  refreshListenable: GoRouterRefreshStream(stream),
/// );
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
class GoRouterRefreshStream extends ChangeNotifier {
  /// Creates a [GoRouterRefreshStream].

  /// Every time the [stream] receives an event the [GoRouter] will refresh its
  /// current route.
