/// A route that displays a UI shell with separate [Navigator]s for its

/// Similar to [ShellRoute], this route class places its sub-route on a
/// different Navigator than the root [Navigator]. However, this route class
/// differs in that it creates separate [Navigator]s for each of its nested
/// branches (i.e. parallel navigation trees), making it possible to build an
/// app with stateful nested navigation. This is convenient when for instance
/// implementing a UI with a [BottomNavigationBar], with a persistent navigation
/// state for each tab.
///
/// A StatefulShellRoute is created by specifying a List of
/// [StatefulShellBranch] items, each representing a separate stateful branch
/// in the route tree. StatefulShellBranch provides the root routes and the
/// Navigator key ([GlobalKey]) for the branch, as well as an optional initial
/// location.
///
/// Like [ShellRoute], either a [builder] or a [pageBuilder] must be provided
/// when creating a StatefulShellRoute. However, these builders differ slightly
/// in that they accept a [StatefulNavigationShell] parameter instead of a
/// child Widget. The StatefulNavigationShell can be used to access information
/// about the state of the route, as well as to switch the active branch (i.e.
/// restoring the navigation stack of another branch). The latter is
/// accomplished by using the method [StatefulNavigationShell.goBranch], for
/// example:
///
/// ```
/// void _onItemTapped(int index) {
///   navigationShell.goBranch(index: index);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The StatefulNavigationShell is also responsible for managing and maintaining
/// the state of the branch Navigators. Typically, a shell is built around this
/// Widget, for example by using it as the body of [Scaffold] with a
/// [BottomNavigationBar].
///
/// When creating a StatefulShellRoute, a [navigatorContainerBuilder] function
/// must be provided. This function is responsible for building the actual
/// container for the Widgets representing the branch Navigators. Typically,
/// the Widget returned by this function handles the layout (including
/// [Offstage] handling etc) of the branch Navigators and any animations needed
/// when switching active branch.
///
/// For a default implementation of [navigatorContainerBuilder] that is
/// appropriate for most use cases, consider using the constructor
/// [StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack].
///
/// With StatefulShellRoute (and any route below it), animated transitions
/// between routes in the same navigation stack works the same way as with other
/// route classes, and can be customized using pageBuilder. However, since
/// StatefulShellRoute maintains a set of parallel navigation stacks,
/// any transitions when switching between branches is the responsibility of the
/// branch Navigator container (i.e. [navigatorContainerBuilder]). The default
/// [IndexedStack] implementation ([StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack]) does not
/// use animated transitions, but an example is provided on how to accomplish
/// this (see link to custom StatefulShellRoute example below).
///
/// See also:
/// * [StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack] which provides a default
/// StatefulShellRoute implementation suitable for most use cases.
