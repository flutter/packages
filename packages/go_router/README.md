# go_router
A declarative routing package for Flutter that uses the Router API to provide a
convenient, url-based API for navigating between different screens. You can
define URL patterns, navigate using a URL, handle deep links, and a number of
other navigation-related scenarios.

## Features
GoRouter has a number of features to make navigation straightforward:

- Parsing path and query parameters using a template syntax (for example, "user/:id')
- Displaying multiple screens for a destination (sub-routes)
- Redirection support - you can re-route the user to a different URL based on
  application state, for example to a sign-in when the user is not
  authenticated
- Support for multiple Navigators via
  [ShellRoute](https://pub.dev/documentation/go_router/latest/go_router/ShellRoute-class.html) -
  you can display an inner Navigator that displays its own pages based on the
  matched route. For example, to display a BottomNavigationBar that stays
  visible at the bottom of the
  screen
- Support for both Material and Cupertino apps
- Backwards-compatibility with Navigator API
