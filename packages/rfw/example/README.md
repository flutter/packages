There are several examples.

* `hello` shows how `RemoteWidget` can render some widgets from a
  description interpreted at runtime.

* `local` shows how to create new local widget definitions for use in
  remote widget descriptions.

* `remote` is a proof-of-concept showing files being obtained from a
  remote server and rendered by the application at runtime.
