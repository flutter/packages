 * This is a simple class for managing a timeout. In the camera we generally keep two timeouts: one
 * for focusing and one for pre-capture metering.
 *
 * <p>We use timeouts to ensure a picture is always captured within a reasonable amount of time even
 * if the settings don't converge and focus can't be locked.
 *
 * <p>You generally check the status of the timeout in the CameraCaptureCallback during the capture
 * sequence and use it to move to the next state if the timeout has passed.
