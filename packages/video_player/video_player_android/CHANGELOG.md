## 2.7.16

* Updates internal Pigeon API to use newer features.

## 2.7.15

* Changes the rotation correction calculation for Android API 29+ to use
  the one that is reported by the video's format instead of the unapplied
  rotation degrees that Exoplayer does not report on Android API 21+.
* Changes the rotation correction calculation for Android APIs 21-28 to 0
  because the Impeller backend used on those API versions correctly rotates
  the video being played automatically.

## 2.7.13

* When `AndroidVideoPlayer` attempts to operate on a `textureId` that is not

## 2.7.12

* Fixes a [bug](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/156451) where
  additional harmless but annoying warnings in the form of native stack traces
  would be printed when the app was backgrounded. There may be additional
  warnings that are not yet fixed, but this should address the
  most common case.

## 2.7.11

* Fixes a [bug](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/156158) where a
  harmless but annoying warning in the form of a native stack trace would be
  printed when a previously disposed video player received a trim memory event
  (i.e. by backgrounding).

## 2.7.10

* Fixes a [bug](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/156158) where
  disposing a video player (including implicitly by switching tabs or views
  in a running app) would cause native stack traces.

* Add a deprecation suppression in advance of a new `SurfaceProducer` API.

## 2.7.4

* Fixes a [bug](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/154559) where
