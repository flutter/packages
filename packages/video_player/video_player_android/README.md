# video\_player\_android

The Android implementation of [`video_player`][1].

## Usage

This package is [endorsed][2], which means you can simply use `video_player`
normally. This package will be automatically included in your app when you do,
so you do not need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml`.

However, if you `import` this package to use any of its APIs directly, you
should add it to your `pubspec.yaml` as usual.
