# material\_ui

**Coming soon \- the official Material Design widget library for Flutter as its own standalone package\!**

`material_ui` will contain the standard collection of visual components (Buttons, Cards, AppBars, etc.) that implement Google's latest Material Design specification.

**Note:** This package will contain the material library previously part of the Flutter framework itself (`package:flutter/material.dart`). It is being decoupled to allow for faster iteration and a more modular ecosystem.

## What's (going to be) Inside?

This package will provide the Material widgets you know and love, including but not limited to:

* **Structure:** `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `Drawer`  
* **Inputs:** `FloatingActionButton`, `TextField`, `Slider`  
* **Display:** `Card`, `Chip`, `ListTile`  
* **Theming:** `ThemeData`, `ColorScheme`

Once landed and published, look forward to updates from [Material 3 Expressive](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/168813)\! 🚀

## Feedback & Roadmap

We are currently migrating the Material library out of the core framework.
