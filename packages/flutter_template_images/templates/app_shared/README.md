**DO NOT UPDATE**: This directory is _deprecated_.

The `skeleton` template is being removed, which as a result means that the
`app_shared` directory is no longer needed (it was used to share template
pieces between `app` and `skeleton`).

If you are looking to update the `app` template, update
[`templates/app`](../app/) directly.
