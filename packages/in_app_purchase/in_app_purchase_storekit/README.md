# in\_app\_purchase\_storekit

The iOS and macOS implementation of [`in_app_purchase`][1].

## Usage

This package has been [endorsed][2], meaning that you only need to add `in_app_purchase`
as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`. This package will be automatically included in your app
when you do,
so you do not need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml`.

However, if you `import` this package to use any of its APIs directly, you
should [add it to your `pubspec.yaml` as usual][3].
