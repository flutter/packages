## 0.6.0

As part of implementing federated architecture and making the interface compatible for other platforms this version contains the following **breaking changes**:

* Changes to the platform agnostic interface:
  * If you used `InAppPurchaseConnection.instance` to access generic In App Purchase APIs, please use `InAppPurchase.instance` instead;
  * The `InAppPurchaseConnection.purchaseUpdatedStream` has been renamed to `InAppPurchase.purchaseStream`;
  * The `InAppPurchaseConnection.queryPastPurchases` method has been removed. Instead, you should use `InAppPurchase.restorePurchases`. This method emits each restored purchase on the `InAppPurchase.purchaseStream`, the `PurchaseDetails` object will be marked with a `status` of `PurchaseStatus.restored`;
  * The `InAppPurchase.completePurchase` method no longer returns an instance `BillingWrapperResult` class (which was Android specific). Instead it will return a completed `Future` if the method executed successfully, in case of errors it will complete with an `InAppPurchaseException` describing the error.
* Android specific changes:
  * The Android specific `InAppPurchaseConnection.consumePurchase` and `InAppPurchaseConnection.enablePendingPurchases` methods have been removed from the platform agnostic interface and moved to the Android specific `InAppPurchaseAndroidPlatformAddition` class:
    * `InAppPurchaseAndroidPlatformAddition.enablePendingPurchases` is a static method that should be called when initializing your App. Access the method like this: `InAppPurchaseAndroidPlatformAddition.enablePendingPurchases()` (make sure to add the following import: `import 'package:in_app_purchase_android/in_app_purchase_android.dart';`);
    * To use the `InAppPurchaseAndroidPlatformAddition.consumePurchase` method, acquire an instance using the `InAppPurchase.getPlatformAddition` method. For example:
  ```dart
  // Acquire the InAppPurchaseAndroidPlatformAddition instance.
  InAppPurchaseAndroidPlatformAddition androidAddition = InAppPurchase.instance.getPlatformAddition<InAppPurchaseAndroidPlatformAddition>();
  // Consume an Android purchase.
  BillingResultWrapper billingResult = await androidAddition.consumePurchase(purchase);
  ```
  * The [billing_client_wrappers](https://pub.dev/documentation/in_app_purchase_android/latest/billing_client_wrappers/billing_client_wrappers-library.html) have been moved into the [in_app_purchase_android](https://pub.dev/packages/in_app_purchase_android) package. They are still available through the [in_app_purchase](https://pub.dev/packages/in_app_purchase) plugin but to use them it is necessary to import the correct package when using them: `import 'package:in_app_purchase_android/billing_client_wrappers.dart';`;
* iOS specific changes:
  * The iOS specific methods `InAppPurchaseConnection.presentCodeRedemptionSheet` and `InAppPurchaseConnection.refreshPurchaseVerificationData` methods have been removed from the platform agnostic interface and moved into the iOS specific `InAppPurchaseIosPlatformAddition` class. To use them acquire an instance through the `InAppPurchase.getPlatformAddition` method like so:
  ```dart
  // Acquire the InAppPurchaseIosPlatformAddition instance.
  InAppPurchaseIosPlatformAddition iosAddition = InAppPurchase.instance.getPlatformAddition<InAppPurchaseIosPlatformAddition>();
  // Present the code redemption sheet.
  await iosAddition.presentCodeRedemptionSheet();
  // Refresh purchase verification data.
  PurchaseVerificationData? verificationData = await iosAddition.refreshPurchaseVerificationData();
  ```
  * The [store_kit_wrappers](https://pub.dev/documentation/in_app_purchase_ios/latest/store_kit_wrappers/store_kit_wrappers-library.html) have been moved into the [in_app_purchase_ios](https://pub.dev/packages/in_app_purchase_ios) package. They are still available in the [in_app_purchase](https://pub.dev/packages/in_app_purchase) plugin, but to use them it is necessary to import the correct package when using them: `import 'package:in_app_purchase_ios/store_kit_wrappers.dart';`;
  * Update the minimum supported Flutter version to 1.20.0.

    * Removed `isRewarded` from [SkuDetailsWrapper].
    * [SkuDetailsWrapper.introductoryPriceCycles] now returns `int` instead of `String`.
    * Above breaking changes are inline with the breaking changes introduced in [Google Play Billing 3.0 release](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/release-notes#3-0).
    * Additional information on some the changes:
      * [Dropping reward SKU support](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9155268?hl=en)

## 0.3.0

* Migrate the `Google Play Library` to 2.0.3.
     * Introduce a new class `BillingResultWrapper` which contains a detailed result of a BillingClient operation.
          * **[Breaking Change]:**  All the BillingClient methods that previously return a `BillingResponse` now return a `BillingResultWrapper`, including: `launchBillingFlow`, `startConnection` and `consumeAsync`.
          * **[Breaking Change]:**  The `SkuDetailsResponseWrapper` now contains a `billingResult` field in place of `billingResponse` field.
          * A `billingResult` field is added to the `PurchasesResultWrapper`.
     * Other Updates to the "billing_client_wrappers":
          * Updates to the `PurchaseWrapper`: Add `developerPayload`, `purchaseState` and `isAcknowledged` fields.
          * Updates to the `SkuDetailsWrapper`: Add `originalPrice` and `originalPriceAmountMicros` fields.
          * **[Breaking Change]:** The `BillingClient.queryPurchaseHistory` is updated to return a `PurchasesHistoryResult`, which contains a list of `PurchaseHistoryRecordWrapper` instead of `PurchaseWrapper`. A `PurchaseHistoryRecordWrapper` object has the same fields and values as A `PurchaseWrapper` object, except that a `PurchaseHistoryRecordWrapper` object does not contain `isAutoRenewing`, `orderId` and `packageName`.
          * Add a new `BillingClient.acknowledgePurchase` API. Starting from this version, the developer has to acknowledge any purchase on Android using this API within 3 days of purchase, or the user will be refunded. Note that if a product is "consumed" via `BillingClient.consumeAsync`, it is implicitly acknowledged.
          * **[Breaking Change]:**  Added `enablePendingPurchases` in `BillingClientWrapper`. The application has to call this method before calling `BillingClientWrapper.startConnection`. See [enablePendingPurchases](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingClient.Builder.html#enablependingpurchases) for more information.
     * Updates to the "InAppPurchaseConnection":
          * **[Breaking Change]:** `InAppPurchaseConnection.completePurchase` now returns a `Future<BillingResultWrapper>` instead of `Future<void>`. A new optional parameter `{String developerPayload}` has also been added to the API. On Android, this API does not throw an exception anymore, it instead acknowledge the purchase. If a purchase is not completed within 3 days on Android, the user will be refunded.
          * **[Breaking Change]:** `InAppPurchaseConnection.consumePurchase` now returns a `Future<BillingResultWrapper>` instead of `Future<BillingResponse>`. A new optional parameter `{String developerPayload}` has also been added to the API.
          * A new boolean field `pendingCompletePurchase` has been added to the `PurchaseDetails` class. Which can be used as an indicator of whether to call `InAppPurchaseConnection.completePurchase` on the purchase.
          * **[Breaking Change]:**  Added `enablePendingPurchases` in `InAppPurchaseConnection`. The application has to call this method when initializing the `InAppPurchaseConnection` on Android. See [enablePendingPurchases](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingClient.Builder.html#enablependingpurchases) for more information.
     * Misc: Some documentation updates reflecting the `BillingClient` migration and some documentation fixes.
     * Refer to [Google Play Billing Library Release Note](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_library_releases_notes#release-2_0) for a detailed information on the update.
