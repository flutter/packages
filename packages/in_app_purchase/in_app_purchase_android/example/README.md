# Platform Implementation Test App

This is a test app for manual testing and automated integration testing
of this platform implementation. It is not intended to demonstrate actual use of
this package, since the intent is that plugin clients use the app-facing
package.

Unless you are making changes to this implementation package, this example is
very unlikely to be relevant.

# In App Purchase Example

### Preparation

There's a significant amount of setup required for testing in-app purchases
successfully, including registering new app IDs and store entries to use for
testing in the Play Developer Console. Google Play requires developers to
configure an app with in-app items for purchase to call their in-app-purchase
APIs. The Google Play Store has extensive documentation on how to do this, and
we've also included a high level guide below.

* [Google Play Billing Overview](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_overview)

### Android

1. Create a new app in the [Play Developer
   Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/) (PDC).

2. Sign up for a merchant's account in the PDC.

3. Create IAPs in the PDC available for purchase in the app. The example assumes
   the following SKU IDs exist:

   - `consumable`: A managed product.
   - `upgrade`: A managed product.
   - `subscription_silver`: A lower level subscription.
   - `subscription_gold`: A higher level subscription.

   Make sure that all of the products are set to `ACTIVE`.

4. Update `APP_ID` in `example/android/app/build.gradle` to match your package
   ID in the PDC.

5. Create an `example/android/keystore.properties` file with all your signing
   information. `keystore.example.properties` exists as an example to follow.
   It's impossible to use any of the `BillingClient` APIs from an unsigned APK.
   See
   [keystore](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#secure-shared-keystore)
   and [signing](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign-apk) and
   [flutter-android](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#signing-the-app)
   for more information.

6. Build a signed apk. `flutter build apk` will work for this, the gradle files
   in this project have been configured to sign even debug builds.

7. Upload the signed APK from step 6 to the PDC, and publish that to the alpha
   test channel. Add your test account as an approved tester. The
   `BillingClient` APIs won't work unless the app has been fully published to
   the alpha channel and is being used by an authorized test account. See
   [here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213)
   for more info.

8. Sign in to the test device with the test account from step #7. Then use
   `flutter run` to install the app to the device and test like normal.
