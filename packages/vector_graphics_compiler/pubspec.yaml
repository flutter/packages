  # This uses an exact upper range because it is an external dependency (see
  # https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/ecosystem/contributing/README.md#dependencies
  # for more information), and this mitigates transitive risk exposure to
  # clients. To update this value:
  # - Audit the package's source diffs between the current max version listed
  #   here and the target version.
  # - Update the max version here to exactly the audited version.
