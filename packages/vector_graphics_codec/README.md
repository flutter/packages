# vector_graphics_codec

An encoding library for `package:vector_graphics`.

This package intentionally creates a tight coupling between
`package:vector_graphics_compiler` and `package:vector_graphics`. Its format has
no stability guarnatees from version to version.

This codec is not meant to have any utility outside of its usage in
`vector_graphics` or the compiler.
