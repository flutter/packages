// TODO(stuartmorgan): Update the generator to not use a .g.dart extension
//  for this, and fix all the resulting analyzer issues (in the generator).
//  Because everything in this file is public, it should follow conventions like
//  documenting public methods that the analyzer would be enforcing if the file
//  weren't opted out. The current approach of using .g.dart is just to
//  simplify importing this package into the monorepo.
