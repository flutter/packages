# DO NOT MAKE A BREAKING CHANGE TO THIS PACKAGE
# DO NOT INCREASE THE MAJOR VERSION OF THIS PACKAGE
#
# This package is used as a second level dependency for many plugins, a major version bump here
# is guaranteed to lead the ecosystem to a version lock (the first plugin that upgrades to version
# 3 of this package cannot be used with any other plugin that have not yet migrated).
#
# Please consider carefully before bumping the major version of this package, ideally it should only
# be done when absolutely necessary and after the ecosystem has already migrated to 2.X.Y version
# that is forward compatible with 3.0.0 (ideally the ecosystem have migrated to depend on:
# `plugin_platform_interface: >=2.X.Y <4.0.0`).
