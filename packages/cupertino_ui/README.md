# cupertino\_ui

**Coming soon \- the official Cupertino widget library for Flutter as its own standalone package\!**

`cupertino_ui` will contain the standard collection of high-fidelity visual components that implement the latest iOS design language (buttons, navigation bars, pickers, etc.).

**Note:** This package will contain the cupertino library previously part of the Flutter framework itself (`package:flutter/cupertino.dart`). It is being decoupled to allow for faster iteration and a more modular ecosystem.

## What's (going to be) Inside?

This package will provide the Cupertino widgets you know and love, including but not limited to:

* **Structure:** `CupertinoPageScaffold`, `CupertinoNavigationBar`  
* **Inputs:** `CupertinoButton`, `CupertinoTextField`, `CupertinoSwitch`  
* **Dialogs:** `CupertinoAlertDialog`, `CupertinoActionSheet`

Once landed and published, look forward to updates from [iOS26](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/170310)\! 🚀

## Feedback & Roadmap

We are currently migrating the Cupertino library out of the core framework.
