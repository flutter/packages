# quick_actions

This Flutter plugin allows you to manage and interact with the application's
home screen quick actions.

Quick actions refer to the [eponymous
concept](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/home-screen-quick-actions)
on iOS and to the [App
Shortcuts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/shortcuts.html) APIs on
Android.

|             | Android   | iOS  |
|-------------|-----------|------|
| **Support** | SDK 16+\* | 9.0+ |

## Usage

Initialize the library early in your application's lifecycle by providing a
callback, which will then be called whenever the user launches the app via a
quick action.

```dart
final QuickActions quickActions = const QuickActions();
quickActions.initialize((shortcutType) {
  if (shortcutType == 'action_main') {
    print('The user tapped on the "Main view" action.');
  }
  // More handling code...
});
```

Finally, manage the app's quick actions, for instance:

```dart
quickActions.setShortcutItems(<ShortcutItem>[
  const ShortcutItem(type: 'action_main', localizedTitle: 'Main view', icon: 'icon_main'),
  const ShortcutItem(type: 'action_help', localizedTitle: 'Help', icon: 'icon_help')
]);
```

Please note, that the `type` argument should be unique within your application
(among all the registered shortcut items). The optional `icon` should be the
name of the native resource (xcassets on iOS or drawable on Android) that the app will display for the
quick action.

### Android

\* The plugin will compile and run on SDK 16+, but will be a no-op below SDK 25
(Android 7.1).

If the drawables used as icons are not referenced other than in your Dart code,
you may need to
[explicitly mark them to be kept](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code#keep-resources)
to ensure that they will be available for use in release builds.

For more information on using this package on Android, see the
[`quick_actions_android` README](https://github.com/flutter/packages/blob/main/packages/quick_actions/quick_actions_android/README.md).
