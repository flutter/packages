## Dependencies to be downloaded using Maven (Invokes `mvn` command). These
## dependencies are always downloaded along with their transitive dependencies.
##
## Dependencies should be specified using groupID:artifactID:version format
## The downloaded dependencies are automatically added to classpath of the
## Java API scanning process. There's no need to specify these again in
## sourcepath and classpath.
##
## Note that when maven based tooling is used, the first run often has to fetch
## all the dependencies and might take some time. However, maven caches the
## artifacts in local repository, thus subsequent runs will be faster.
#maven_downloads:
## For these dependencies, both source and JARs are downloaded.
