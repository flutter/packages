## 2.6.0

* Updates the minimum allowed verison of the Google Maps SDK to 8.4, for privacy
  manifest support.
    * This means that applications using this package can no longer support
      iOS 13 or 14, as the versions of the Google Maps SDK that support those
      versions do not have privacy manifests, so cannot be used in published
      applications once the new App Store enforcement of manifests takes effect.
* Includes the Google Maps SDK's [GoogleMapsPrivacy bundle](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/config#add-apple-privacy-manifest-file)
  manifest entries direct in the plugin, so that package clients do not need to
  manually add that privacy bundle to the application build.
