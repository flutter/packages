/// ## Tile Coordinates
///
/// Note that the world is projected using the Mercator projection
/// (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection)) with the left (west) side
/// of the map corresponding to -180 degrees of longitude and the right (east) side of the map
/// corresponding to 180 degrees of longitude. To make the map square, the top (north) side of the
/// map corresponds to 85.0511 degrees of latitude and the bottom (south) side of the map
/// corresponds to -85.0511 degrees of latitude. Areas outside this latitude range are not rendered.
///
/// At each zoom level, the map is divided into tiles and only the tiles that overlap the screen are
/// downloaded and rendered. Each tile is square and the map is divided into tiles as follows:
///
/// * At zoom level 0, one tile represents the entire world. The coordinates of that tile are
/// (x, y) = (0, 0).
/// * At zoom level 1, the world is divided into 4 tiles arranged in a 2 x 2 grid.
/// * ...
/// * At zoom level N, the world is divided into 4N tiles arranged in a 2N x 2N grid.
///
/// Note that the minimum zoom level that the camera supports (which can depend on various factors)
/// is GoogleMap.getMinZoomLevel and the maximum zoom level is GoogleMap.getMaxZoomLevel.
///
/// The coordinates of the tiles are measured from the top left (northwest) corner of the map.
/// At zoom level N, the x values of the tile coordinates range from 0 to 2N - 1 and increase from
/// west to east and the y values range from 0 to 2N - 1 and increase from north to south.
