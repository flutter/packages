Overhaul lifecycle management in GoogleMapsPlugin.

GoogleMapController is now uniformly driven by implementing `DefaultLifecycleObserver`. That observer is registered to a lifecycle from one of three sources:

1. For v2 plugin registration, `GoogleMapsPlugin` obtains the lifecycle via `ActivityAware` methods.
2. For v1 plugin registration, if the activity implements `LifecycleOwner`, it's lifecycle is used directly.
3. For v1 plugin registration, if the activity does not implement `LifecycleOwner`, a proxy lifecycle is created and driven via `ActivityLifecycleCallbacks`.

## 1.0.4

* A few minor formatting changes and additions of `@Nullable` annotations.
* Removed pass-through of `activityHashCode` to `GoogleMapController`.
* Replaced custom lifecycle state ints with `androidx.lifecycle.Lifecycle.State` enum.
