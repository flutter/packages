# Code sharing

This package shares most of its code with the other `google_maps_flutter_ios_*`
packages in this repository, so after changing any code files in this package
run:
`dart run tool/sync_shared_files.dart`

See [the shared directory README](../google_maps_flutter_ios_shared_code/README.md)
for more details.
