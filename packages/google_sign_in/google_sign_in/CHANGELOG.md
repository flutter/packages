## 4.0.0

* **Breaking change**. Migrate from the deprecated original Android Support
  Library to AndroidX. This shouldn't result in any functional changes, but it
  requires any Android apps using this plugin to [also
  migrate](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) if they're
  using the original support library.

  This was originally incorrectly pushed in the `3.3.0` update.

## 3.3.0+1

* **Revert the breaking 3.3.0 update**. 3.3.0 was known to be breaking and
  should have incremented the major version number instead of the minor. This
  revert is in and of itself breaking for anyone that has already migrated
  however. Anyone who has already migrated their app to AndroidX should
  immediately update to `4.0.0` instead. That's the correctly versioned new push
  of `3.3.0`.

## 3.3.0

* **BAD**. This was a breaking change that was incorrectly published on a minor
  version upgrade, should never have happened. Reverted by 3.3.0+1.

* **Breaking change**. Migrate from the deprecated original Android Support
  Library to AndroidX. This shouldn't result in any functional changes, but it
  requires any Android apps using this plugin to [also
  migrate](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) if they're
  using the original support library.

  [here](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Updating-Flutter-projects-to-Gradle-4.1-and-Android-Studio-Gradle-plugin-3.0.1).

        maven {                              // NEW
            url "https://maven.google.com"   // NEW
        }                                    // NEW
    }
}
