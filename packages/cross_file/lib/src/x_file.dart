/// The interface for a cross-platform "file", [XFile].
///
/// An `XFile` is a container that wraps a bunch of [bytes] with
/// some optional (platform-dependent) metadata, like a [path], [mimeType]
/// or [name].
///
/// Depending on the platform, the data can be backed by several different
/// storages, like a `File` from `dart:io`, or a `Blob` from `package:web`.
///
/// This class is a very limited subset of dart:io [File], so all
/// the methods should seem familiar.
///
/// Use the platform-specific factories to create `XFile`s with the most
/// appropriate backend for your platform. See the [XFileFactory] class
/// available for `web` and `native`.
