# flutter_svg_test

### Testing

This package provides a set of functions to find images generated by
[**flutter_svg**  ](https://github.com/dnfield/flutter_svg/tree/master/packages/flutter_svg)
in widget tests.

The methods find elements with the `SvgPicture` type and compare either the `BytesLoader` or the
configuration of the `BytesLoader` with the giving test attribute.

### Example

#### Find by BytesLoader

The following example shows how you can find svgs with the matching `SvgAssetLoader`.

<?code-excerpt "test/flutter_svg_test_test.dart (ByLoader)"?>
```dart
testWidgets('asset svg', (WidgetTester widgetTester) async {
  final SvgPicture asset = SvgPicture.asset('test/flutter_logo.svg');
  await widgetTester.pumpWidget(
    DefaultAssetBundle(
      bundle: _FakeAssetBundle(),
      child: asset,
    ),
  );

  expect(find.svg(asset.bytesLoader), findsOneWidget);
});
```

#### Find by svg path

Sometimes it is more convenient instead of instantiating the whole `BytesLoader`
to compare only specific attributes.

The following example shows how you can find svgs with the specified attribute.

<?code-excerpt "test/flutter_svg_test_test.dart (ByPath)"?>
```dart
testWidgets('asset svg with path', (WidgetTester widgetTester) async {
  const String svgPath = 'test/flutter_logo.svg';
  await widgetTester.pumpWidget(
    DefaultAssetBundle(
      bundle: _FakeAssetBundle(),
      child: SvgPicture.asset(svgPath),
    ),
  );

  expect(find.svgAssetWithPath(svgPath), findsOneWidget);
});
```
