# Flutter Packages Style Guide

## Introduction

This style guide outlines the coding conventions for contributions to the
flutter/packages repository.

## Style Guides

Code should follow the relevant style guides, and use the correct
auto-formatter, for each language, as described in
[the repository contributing guide's Style section](https://github.com/flutter/packages/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#style).

## Best Practices

- Code should follow the guidance and principles described in
  [the flutter/packages contribution guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/ecosystem/contributing/README.md).
- Code should be tested. Changes to plugin packages, which include code written
  in C, C++, Java, Kotlin, Objective-C, or Swift, should have appropriate tests
  as described in [the plugin test guidance](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/ecosystem/testing/Plugin-Tests.md).
- PR descriptions should include the Pre-Review Checklist from
  [the PR template](https://github.com/flutter/packages/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md),
  with all of the steps completed.
