# Flutter Packages

[![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/flutter/packages.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/flutter/packages/master)

This repo is a companion repo to the main [flutter repo](
https://github.com/flutter/flutter). It contains the source code for Flutter's
first-party packages (i.e., packages developed by the core Flutter team).
Check the [`packages`](./packages) directory to see all packages.

These packages are also available on [pub](https://pub.dartlang.org/flutter/packages).

## Issues

Please file any issues, bugs, or feature requests in the [main flutter
repo](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new).

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute a new package to the Flutter ecosystem, please
see the documentation for [developing packages](https://flutter.io/developing-packages/). You can store
your package source code in any GitHub repository (the present repo is only
intended for packages developed by the core Flutter team). Once your package
is ready you can [publish](https://flutter.io/developing-packages/#publish)
to the [pub repository](https://pub.dartlang.org/).

If you wish to contribute a change to any of the existing packages in this repo,
please review our [contribution guide](https://github.com/flutter/packages/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
and send a [pull request](https://github.com/flutter/packages/pulls).
